>You have to be willing to work hard, learn a lot, and be consistent. You need to persist when things get tough. Talk yourself out of the moments of desperation when you feel like you are not cut out for this. That’s all it takes, and everyone can do these things with a bit of practice.

---

>The two biggest mistakes I found at first were:
>1. Fear of failure. Because I was the new guy, I was constantly in fear of my code being wrong or poorly made, so I spent a lot of time double-checking everything and adhered to coding best practices. Because of this, I rarely attempted solutions in creative new ways because of my fear that it might not work correctly at the end. This effectively shut down my drive to learn new things.
>2. Doing things because “X” person who knows better than me said so. I did this a lot at first. While not completely wrong, doing things in a certain way only because “X” expert on the matter said so — without knowing why — lead to me not really knowing when to why things were done the way they were. I soon learned that there were exceptions to everything, and that you always should know the reason behind best practices.

---

>“Libraries and Frameworks may become obsolete, but the concepts and solutions they propose often survive the test of time.”

>I’ve met a lot of developers over the past 2 years I’ve been a web developer. Along my journey, I’ve met a few developers who really stood out — developers who were clearly in a league of their own, and to whom me and everyone else looked up to. I found these individuals shared quite a few characteristics, which I’d like to share with you right now. These are in my opinion the secret sauce to being a successful web developer:
>
>- Love what you do. This is simply the most important characteristic of them all. If you don’t love what you do (be it CSS Styling or JavaScript), it will truly show in what you do. Those who are passionate about what they do often clearly stand out from the crowd.
>- Be generous and share your knowledge. It’s very easy to want to keep that new CSS/JavaScript hack you found that solves the project’s issues a secret, but please don’t. The people who share their knowledge the most are often the most valuable, since they can be placed in any kind of team and improve it’s quality by a huge margin.
>- Always be on the lookout for new things. Most of the successful developers I’ve met share this common trait. Whether it be by reading blogs, spending lots of time in programming related discussions, or even talking about what’s new in web development during lunch breaks. Being on the lookout for new things all the time allows the best developers to always stay ahead of the curve.

### VS Code Tips

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

Open the command palette
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd>

Select whole word under cursor
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>

With nothing selected, add whole line to the clipboard
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>

Shift line contents vertically
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + up or down arrow keys

Copy line contents vertically
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + up or down arrow keys

Custom shortcuts can be [created and support conditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPqXP_kLzpo&t=2605s)!

#### Snippets

Snippets are saved as either a local or global [json file that can be modified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPqXP_kLzpo&t=3040s). There are some really great examples in this video that demonstrate how to build efficient snippets.

To access, click on the settings cog in lower left, then select "user snippets."

VS Code also comes with [Emmet snippets](https://docs.emmet.io/) enabled by default! This allows you to generate lots of structure quickly. For example:

`div>ul>ui*4` and `tab` turns into

```html
<div>
  <ul>
    <ui></ui>
    <ui></ui>
    <ui></ui>
    <ui></ui>
  </ul>
</div>
```

You can take this to extremes like `div.content#intro>table>tr.headers>th*4^tr*7>td*4`, which creates a div with an 8x4 table, and adds some classes and IDs to elements.

#### Settings

If you use the command palette to turn on `setting sync`, you can export all (or some) of your settings with your GitHub account.

#### Debugging

The video also contains a great overview of [using debugging](https://youtu.be/WPqXP_kLzpo?t=4020). Debugging looks incredibly powerful, and I feel a little foolish for not looking into it sooner! I will definitely be trying this out soon.

#### Version Control

From the [git tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPqXP_kLzpo&t=4725s), you can perform all of your basic git actions. With GitHub integration, you can actually publish new repositories right from inside VS Code!
