**⚠ Currently in planning phase! Pardon the gaps ⚠**

My long-term roadmap for a career in development.

* TOC
{: toc}

## Phase 1 - The Fundamentals (short term)

When I started Learning Log, I quickly realized that my self-taught fundamentals up to this point needed to be re-established formally and from the ground up. While this phase will largely target HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will be doing my best to gather as much general development learning and perspective as possible. Hard skills benefiting development, like Git, testing, and CI, and soft skills like documentation and team collaboration will also be emphasized. The information gathered in this phase will help to chart and prioritize all future phases.

### Timeline

Phase 1 should conclude January, 2021.

### Projects

- [ ] AGWSU (intern developer, project management)
- [ ] Untitled True Dungeon Token Platform (junior developer, project management)
- [ ] FreeCodeCamp HTML/CSS projects (fundamentals)
- [ ] FreeCodeCamp Javascript projects (fundamentals)

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

- [ ] Hacktoberfest 2020 (open source event)
- [ ] Scrimmage Product Lab (rapid launch workshop)

### Key Progression Objectives

#### HTML and CSS

- [ ] TBD (at least 4+ progression items)

#### Javascript

- [ ] TBD (at least 4+ progression items)

### Output

This phase will conclude when I have completed both FreeCodeCamp certifications, have participated and contributed to open source projects, and wrapped my first team project.

## Phase 2 - Frameworks (short term)

With a far more solid foundation and some miles under my belt, it is time to revisit frameworks and where I entered into this process. Phase 2 will focus primarily on learning the latest frameworks and how to utilize them in a modern development firm.

### Timeline

Phase 2 should conclude April, 2021.

### Projects

- [ ] Finish and polish Tic-Tac-React (portfolio)
- [ ] Complete and polish FirebaseUI Auth (portfolio)
- [ ] Redesign my portfolio site from the ground up (portfolio)
- [ ] Fully document and polish Learning Log (portfolio)

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

- [ ] TBD

### Key Progression Objectives

#### React

- [ ] TBD (at least 8+ progression items)

#### Redux

- [ ] TBD (at least 2+ progression items)

#### Firebase

- [ ] TBD (at least 2+ progression items)

#### Sass

- [ ] TBD (at least 2+ progression items)

### Output

This phase will conclude when I have finished and polished a total of no less than four personal (non-FreeCodeCamp) projects and fully updated my portfolio and resume.

## Phase 3 - Portfolio Building (1 year)

The next step is to start aggressively finishing and polishing projects to have a full portfolio of personal projects, as well as a short list of open source contributions. My target will be to have 8 complete projects to showcase. During this phase, it may be good to begin reaching out to employers.

### Timeline

Phase 3 will be a variable timeline, as who's to say what the hiring market will look like by then. My personal goal would be to be employed with a development firm before August, 2021.

### Projects

- [ ] Finish and polish Realtime To-Do (portolio)
- [ ] Perhaps begin on home bar inventory management site, utilizing web scraper data? (portfolio)
- [ ] Determine additional personal projects (portfolio)

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

- [ ] Complete 5+ code challenges weekly
- [ ] Contribute 5+ accepted PRs to open-source projects

### Key Progression Objectives

#### Computer Science 

- [ ] TBD (complete 3+ books/lecture series)

### Output

This phase will complete when I successfully obtain a job in development.

## Phase 4 - Targeting (3 years)

With a new career in development, I need to quickly seek to:

- Build my network
- Identify missing skills
- Identify good sources of information to grow my skills and stay relevant
- Target my learning, and attempt to synergize at-home learning with at-work learning
- Build foundational understanding with computer science courses and bolster my math

### Timeline

Phase 4 should span most likely my first two years in a development role. Next steps may vary, depending on what my experience is like and what I learn, and what team I join. Assuming that I am able to find a team that encourages collaboration and growth, soliciting feedback from my peers and seeking to pair program would be key activities to learn how people approach problems and identify areas where I need to improve. This would also be a great environment to ask questions about best practices and optimization.

### Projects

- [ ] Complete bar management platform (full-stack project w/ mobile, SaaS)

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

- [ ] Participate in 4+ hackathon events
- [ ] Contribute 25+ accepted PRs to open-source projects

### Key Progression Objectives

#### TBD

### Output

This phase will complete when...TBD

## Phase 5 - Specialization (5 years)

After solidifying my career in development, moving towards specialization should become a key focus. Machine learning is a critical skill for the next decade, and something I would be extremely interested to look into, as well as data visualization. I will need to be watching trends within the industry and market to see if there are different leading sectors by this point.

### Timeline

As I move from a junior role to a mid role, specialization needs to be on my mind for the future. I do not currently have a clear idea of when exactly the process of specialization would "begin", but my suspicion is around reaching mid and working towards senior.

### Projects

- [ ] TBD

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

- [ ] TBD

### Key Progression Objectives

#### Machine Learning

#### Project Management

### Output

This phase will complete when...TBD

## Phase 6 - Leadership (10 years)

Between mid and senior level, I should already be taking it on myself to volunteer for leadership opportunities, training newer developers, spearheading projects, and leading by example. The next step would be aiming to move into a formal leadership role to coach teams and manage projects, while seeking to more directly contribute towards larger company goals.

### Timeline

As I move from a mid role to a senior role, I will be thinking about leadership and attempting to more directly contribute to company success. I do not currently have a clear idea of when exactly specialization would begin, but my suspicion is in the time leading up to senior, depending on career progression paths at development firms.

### Projects

- [ ] TBD
