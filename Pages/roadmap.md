**⚠ Currently in planning phase! Pardon the gaps ⚠**

My long-term roadmap for a career in development.

* TOC
{: toc}

## Phase 1 - The Fundamentals (short term)

When I started Learning Log, I quickly realized that my self-taught fundamentals up to this point needed to be re-established formally and from the ground up. While this phase will largely target HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will be doing my best to gather as much general development learning and perspective as possible. The information gathered in this phase will help to chart and prioritize all future phases.

### Timeline

Phase 1 should conclude January, 2021.

### Projects

- [ ] AGWSU (full project lifecycle, project management)
- [ ] FreeCodeCamp HTML/CSS projects (fundamentals)
- [ ] FreeCodeCamp Javascript projects (fundamentals)

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

- [ ] Hacktoberfest 2020 (open source)

### Key Progression Objectives

#### HTML and CSS

- [ ]

#### Javascript

- [ ]

### Output

This phase will conclude when I have completed both FreeCodeCamp certifications, have participated and contributed to open source projects, and wrapped my first team project.

## Phase 2 - Frameworks (short term)

With a far more solid foundation and some miles under my belt, it is time to revisit frameworks and where I entered into this process. Phase 2 will focus primarily on learning the latest frameworks and how to utilize them in a modern development firm.

### Timeline

Phase 2 should conclude March, 2021.

### Projects

- [ ] Finish and polish Tic-Tac-React (portfolio)
- [ ] Complete and polish FirebaseUI Auth (portfolio)
- [ ] Redesign my portfolio site from the ground up (portfolio)

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

- [ ] TBD

### Key Progression Objectives

#### React

#### Redux

### Output

## Phase 3 - Portfolio Building (1 year)

The next step is to start aggressively finishing and polishing projects to have a full portfolio. My target will be to have 10 complete projects to showcase. During this phase, it may be good to begin reaching out to employers.

### Timeline

Phase 3 will be a variable timeline, as who's to say what the hiring market will look like by then. My personal goal would be to be employed with a development firm before July, 2021.

### Projects

- [ ] Finish and polish Realtime To-Do (portfolio)

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

- [ ] TBD

### Key Progression Objectives

#### TBD

### Output

This phase will complete when I successfully obtain a job in development.

## Phase 4 - Targeting (3 years)

With a new career in development, I need to quickly seek to:

- Build my network
- Identify missing skills
- Identify good sources of information to grow my skills and stay relevant
- Target my learning, and attempt to synergize at-home learning with at-work learning
- Build foundational understanding with computer science courses and bolster my math

### Timeline

Phase 4 should span at least my first two years in a development role. Next steps may vary, depending on what my experience is like and what I learn.

### Projects

- [ ] TBD

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

### Output

## Phase 5 - Specialization (5 years)

After solidifying my career in development, moving towards specialization should become a key focus. Machine learning is a critical skill for the next decade, and something I would be extremely interested to look into, as well as data science.

### Timeline

As I move from a junior role to a mid role, specialization needs to be on my mind for the future. I do not currently have a clear idea of when exactly specialization would begin, but my suspicion is after reaching mid and working towards senior.

### Projects

- [ ] TBD

### Events

Events to attend that fall within this phase:

### Key Progression Objectives

### Output

This phase will complete when...TBD

## Phase 6 - Leadership (10 years)

Between mid and senior level, I should already be taking it on myself to volunteer for leadership opportunities, training newer devs, spearheading projects, and leading by example. The next step would be aiming to move into a formal leadership role to coach teams and manage projects, while seeking to more directly contribute towards larger company goals.

### Timeline

As I move from a mid role to a senior role, I will be thinking about leadership and attempting to more directly contribute to company success. I do not currently have a clear idea of when exactly specialization would begin, but my suspicion is in the time leading up to senior, depending on career progression paths at development firms.
