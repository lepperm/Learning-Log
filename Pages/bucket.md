My Bucket is a list of "Real Developer" activities, initially copied and inspired by [this post from Ginny Fahs](https://blog.prototypr.io/wondering-if-youre-a-real-developer-yet-try-making-a-bucket-list-281275482155). The items are in no particular order, but they are all activities that I would one day like to complete!
