Learning Log is my web development education hub, where I chronicle my progression and skill acquisition, starting as a newbie.

Here, you can find:
- An overview of skills I am working to develop
- My progress towards mastering skills and the resources being used to get there
- Statistics for my skill development and this site
- A dynamically generated list of tasks that I am using to guide my learning
- Logs of my learning activities and insight into my problem-solving process
- Blog posts covering a variety of topics

My long-term roadmap for a career in development can be found here:  
[Learning Log - Roadmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap)

You can find the source code for this site on GitLab:  
[Learning Log - GitLab](https://gitlab.com/maxlepper/learning-log)

You can find my personal portfolio website here:  
[Max Lepper - Portfolio](https://maxlepper.me) (Early draft, expect this to change drastically!)

I also have a small bucket list of developer goals here:

This site was heavily inspired by the writing of [Syk Houdeib](https://syknapse.github.io/Syk-Houdeib/) and their awesome [Learning Tracker repo](https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker/). I can't thank them enough!
