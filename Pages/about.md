Learning Log is a hub for information and statistics chronicling my web development journey. 

Here, you can find:
- Logs of what I am working on
- An overview of skills I am working to develop
- My progress towards mastering skills and the resources being used to get there
- Statistics for my skills and this site

You can find the source code for this site on GitLab:  
[Learning Log - GitLab](https://gitlab.com/maxlepper/learning-log)

You can find my personal portfolio website here:  
[Max Lepper - Portfolio](https://maxlepper.me) (Early draft, expect this to change drastically!)

This site was heavily inspired by the writing of [Syk Houdeib](https://syknapse.github.io/Syk-Houdeib/) and their awesome [Learning Tracker repo](https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker/). I can't thank you enough!
