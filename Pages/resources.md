Learning development isn't just about building demos, taking courses, and reading books! There is an incredibly deep _and_ wide pool of information that you will need to be able to retrieve information from, and things are constantly changing!

The resources below may be helpful to reference or utilize as compliments to your learning process, or as a handy way to double-check yourself, or to give you a bit of inspiration for a problem or design you may be working on. If you have any suggestions that you would like me to add to the list, please [send me a message](mailto:{{ site.author.email }})!

### Validators / Linters

Validators and linters can be used to check if a certain file type is correctly structured to ensure that it can be read, and may help clean up formatting and spacing.

**JSON**

**YAML**

**GitLab CI Lint**
- <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/lint.html>
  - I couldn't find any direct pathways to the linter. If you create a GitLab repo with the intent of using CI, the instructions above will show you how to access the linter, and you can create a bookmark from there!
