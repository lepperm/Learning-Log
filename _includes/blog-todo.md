**Statistics**
- [ ] Calculate current active streak against javascript current time, not site build time

**Modularity**
- [ ] Make the skill collection and data make skill collection and data generic (for example, a languages learning breakdown)

**Quality and Code Health**
- [ ] Figure out how to copy compiled `Skills.json` and `Search.json` files to the `_data` folder at build
- [ ] Documentation

**User Experience**
- [ ] Improve CSS for cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Some way to distinguish between different groupings of topics within blog posts.
  - Alternating background shading behind paragraphs (like excel tables)? Horizontal rules? Extra headers? Possibly mock up some variants and take a poll from readers

**Brainstorming**
- [ ] A configurable floating TOC element
- [ ] "Year in pixels" style blogging map for days with posts
  - [ ] Navigate through to see all posts for that day (can reuse existing search query w/ date format `%b %d, %Y`)
