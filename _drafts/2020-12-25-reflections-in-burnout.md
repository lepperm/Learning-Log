I have experienced burnout before at various points in my life. They all had a pretty similar feel and the result was the same - I got overwhelmed and my brain would refuse to be productive and I had to stop and recover. A few days to a week would be all it took before I got antsy enough to brush myself off and excitedly dive into a new project.

This time has been a radically different experience.

The increasingly intense insomnia I've suffered from over the previous weeks
suddenly having all motivation to do most things drain out of me
exhausted, anxious, and feeling overwhelmed

in an art chat, a handful of artists were all talking about being overwhelmed and exhausted from commissions for the holidays and pulling extremely long hours and feeling guilty for not getting more done. In response, one person posted an infographic listing off some symptoms of burnout:

- little to no motivation
- insomnia
- emotionally overwhelmed
- amplified anxiety
- exhaustion
- easily triggered

I definitely had five ouf of the six - almost a full bingo card.

The next day, got an email about insurance that we've been fighting to resolve for over four months, and I definitely got more irritated than usual. So, scratch that, I caught all six symptoms! âœ¨

the thing that quickly became apparent is just how much of who I was I had grafted into making this change. I couldn't listen to music without thinking about how I could use it to better express myself as a brand and if there would be ways to connect with people over music. I couldn't travel somewhere without thinking about how I could maybe use the opportunity to collect photos for social media or blog posts to write about the **work** I was doing towards burnout. I couldn't sit still without thinking that I was wasting my time and harming myself by not continuing to charge towards my [ardent wish]({% post_url journal/2020/10/2020-10-02-on-time-productivity-and-the-pursuit-of-a-better-future %}#ardent-wish).

I struggled to view burnout as anything other than yet another thing I had to work through and was impeding my progress towards my goals. It was irritating, and frustrating, and felt painful to watch the time slip by and both not feel any better or make any progress towards things I cared about.
