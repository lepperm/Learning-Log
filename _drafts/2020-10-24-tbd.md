## Journal

drawer components

checkbox accordion

slider accordion
({{page.references[0]}})

really struggling to get material ui css rules to work for "yearless" disabled slider, tried a ton of variations in both `makeStyles` and a custom component `withStyles`. Eventually opted to just collapse the section with "yearless" and use disabled colors on the handles for during the animation.

## Tasklist

- [x] Post my daily updates on the TD Collection discord
- [x] Break main app elements into smaller components
  - [x] filter category accordions
    - [x] checkbox-style
    - [ ] slider-style
- [ ] Make the landing page background scale to always cover all elements
