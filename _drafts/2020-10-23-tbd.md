## Journal


Neal has said that he'll be back Sunday, and then I'm heading out for work. I'll be back basically just for Halloween, and then out of town again for a few days. With the amount of time I have left to contribute before the end of the lab, I really want to get things polished up so that I have my best work live before Neal dives in

working to create token card component
easy enough to extract from main
trying to learn JSON objects a bit better
Understanding getting the main key versus subkeys, accessing data
can't map `tokenData` directly, have to use `Object.keys(tokenData)` to map, access subkeys with `tokenData[key].subkey` ({{page.references[0]}})

Cloned and slightly modified my single sample token to map out multiple cards, working well

Issues getting dynamic images to load,
({{page.references[1]}}). Able to successfully use `require` to get images working with a specific name. Add `radius: 50%` gives the tokens a great clean look that allows the `onHover` styling to show through

Learning more about managing themes, properly pipe in theme colors

reintegrate navigation component, add `searchBar` prop to allow the same nav component to be reused

add search bar
css needs some work

breaking feature cards from landing page into components
learned that you can pass entire components into components, super cool! ({{page.references[2]}})

back to search bar, fixed css
working to properly get input field data
got hands-on practice with `useRef` ({{page.references[3]}}) and using `onChange` and `onClick` to get the current field values, as well as writing the final value to state when submitted. Everything outputs to the console and an alert box right now, but it demonstrates that things are updating appropriately.

struggling to dynamically require images, eventually got it working

working on testing, working on documentation more, cleaning up a few details, adding parameter details to component functions

timeout and memory error on CI, adjust pipeline but no luck
