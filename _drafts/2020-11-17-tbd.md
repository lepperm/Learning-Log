## Journal

Working on catching up on posts and personal tasks

Thanks to React script, figured out a quick-and-dirty way to update Learning Log stats with Node.js
[Copy files via `copyFileSync` to override]({{page.references[0]}})
I'm sure I could do something similar with Ruby, but since I know how to do this with Node.js _right now_ that's what I went with.

VBA programming at work on a form (not included in Learning Log time)
refamilarizing myself with the syntax, had been a while

## Tasklist

- [ ] [Change the `create-react-component-folder` template](https://github.com/snaerth/create-react-component-folder#publishing-templates) for Storybook stories in my Portfolio
- [x] Finally automate updating stats for Learning Log
