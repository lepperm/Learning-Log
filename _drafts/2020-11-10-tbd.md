## Journal

({{page.references[0]}})

Helping family over the weekend
exhausted from the past two weeks, had to turn my brain off yesterday just to get back up and running again.
Knocking out chores Monday and didn't get around to making much progress

working on determining next steps
Four main initiatives:
- TD Collection
- AGWSU
- Portfolio
- Progression entries / FreeCodeCamp challenges

To be able to contribute to TD Collection and AGWSU in their current state, I need to revisit learning Redux and Firebase from the ground up.
My portfolio is very outdated and looks poor, so getting that polished and looking better should be a high priority to focus more on my brand. Neal has offered to help review and critique my UX designs, which would be very helpful. I have some ideas, but I'm not totally sure how to execute them.
At the same time, I'm concerned that I might be getting too wrapped up in frameworks again without continuing with my fundamentals. May be good to continue with FreeCodeCamp and progression entries

At this time, I'm thinking I may need to focus on my Portfolio first. After that, I can gauge team interest on TDC and AGWSU. Neal has mentioned wanting to get TDC filtering working before the end of November, but I'll require some time to get up and running, so it may be best if he moves forward without me if that's a target he wants to hit, and I can take on more of the roll I had with AGWSU, albeit more in the actual code. I need to start formalizing my JavaScript learning, as well, so that will most likely be my core focus when time-sensitive requests are resolved.
