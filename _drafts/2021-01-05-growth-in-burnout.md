## Journal

{% include focus-box.html focus="Rest" theme="Recovery" %}

able to take a few hours these past few days to finally genuinely sit and relax and not be working on something

the buzzing is still stopped, I no longer feel incredibly anxious 24/7 and my insomnia is gone

still feeling exhausted, and nervous about returning to work tomorrow, so I want to be acutely mindful of my mental state going forward

I want to be more patient with myself
slow down
be mindful of just how much I'm taking on
be mindful of what my body is telling me

### What could be better?
