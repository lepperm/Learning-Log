## Journal

New prompt
[Oblique Strategies]({{page.references[0]}})
Interesting approach, however I've struggled to get cards that I could figure out how to apply

[breakdown of values in the default Material UI theme]({{page.references[3]}})

Issue on staging site, since GitLab hosts at a
fixed router to catch all mismatched urls and redirect to landing to "reset" the path

missed converting Navigation, went ahead and switched it over to a functional component. Maybe good to add a state to show or hide the search bar, then can reuse between landing and main app. Need to figure out if I can still have the drawer clip if the navigation bar is used externally, or should I move navigation inside the landing and main app components?

Did more digging into themes, adjusted colors, worked to fix background colors
still can't fix the background image
Finally found where fonts were declared `App.css` which I had completely missed until I searched the AGWSU project files
Now successfully declared and added to build folder

## Tasklist

- [x] Fix fonts so that they show up correctly
- [ ] Make the landing page background scale to always cover all elements
