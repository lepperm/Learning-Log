## Journal

No direct progress today, so zero logged minutes, however I have been working on a new blog post. This new post is over 2,000 words - nearly doubling my record so far! In it, I discuss risk mitigation and balancing finite resources. There's been a lot of blogging about blogging so far, which might be annoying. That said, I have enjoyed the mental exercise of breaking down my approach, analyzing exactly where my failures occurred, and what I am doing to mitigate future failures and incrementally improve the returns on invested resources.

Since I was working on producing blog content, but did not manage to complete the final editing pass tonight, I feel that a little log about it to keep my streak going is okay! ðŸ˜‰ I don't think anyone is subscribed to my RSS yet, but please look for my new post tomorrow!
