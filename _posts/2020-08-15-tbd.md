## Journal

Mobile testing revealed that the Skills page was resolving to `/skills.html`, which was breaking anchor tag linking to the appropriate entry in the table. With the changes to the Category and Tag badges, I went ahead and changed the skills for journals into badges, as well.

[]({{page.references[0]}})
