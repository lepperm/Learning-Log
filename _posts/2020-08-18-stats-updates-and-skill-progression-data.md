## Journal

Adding Mermaid.JS back in without the use of a plug made it very snappy, so I was excited to clean up the basic pie chart  in place.

creating reusable components
- mermaid injector
- icons to includes
- return to top
- progression-specific icons and coloring
- In-skill shorthand syntax for easier updating

using sass for the first time
- setting up color variables
- adding user feedback for clickable badges and icons

changes to skill and progression items, getting happier with setup. Unsure what to do with the key, or if it is even needed.


## Tasklist

- [x] Make Stats pie chart more legible and make components easily reusable for use in posts or other areas around the blog
