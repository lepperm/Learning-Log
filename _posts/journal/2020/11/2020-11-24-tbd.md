## Journal

Not to toot my own horn, but I feel like I made great progress towards getting caught up last night! The automatic drafts handling that I rolled out yesterday has taken a surprising amount of workflow-related stress off my shoulders. I really want to make an effort to more frequently identify [kaizen]({{page.references[0]}}) opportunities like this, as the core change to the code was maybe two lines. In fact, there have been a few lingering ideas that I might try to work on today!

listening to the career development roadmap on developer tea, will maybe write up something when I get through all the steps

ended up getting pretty busy and not making much progress on blog posts.

## Tasklist

- [x] Add an additional notice on posts that are drafts that it is, in fact, a draft
- [x] Update README.md
- [x] Tidy up blog todo lists
- [x] Add proficiency Front Matter to Skill entries to denote items that I am pretty comfortable with but maybe don't have a lot of time towards
- [x] Add proficiency badges to skills in table and progression pages
- [ ] Add a "Books" page that scoops up all book progression items and outputs them to a table (can be hidden for now!)
- [x] Create "Quotes" json
- [ ] Build a "Quotes" element to replace existing quotes
- [ ] Look into duplicated "Firebase" entries in Skills page on Learning Log
- [ ] [Change the `create-react-component-folder` template](https://github.com/snaerth/create-react-component-folder#publishing-templates) for [Storybook stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf) in my Portfolio
- [ ] ~~11/30/20 - Compile results of post frequency poll~~ (since the pain point has been eliminated and poll engagement has been minimal, I don't know if there will be much value in doing this anymore)
