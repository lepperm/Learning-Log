## Journal

({{page.references[0]}})

Following up from yesterday (link here),

Neal suggested that maybe, rather than drafting these blogs with my rough short-hand and then struggling to catch over multiple days up if I fall behind, I just make sure to post them every single day, regardless of what state they are in. Ship daily. The content may be very rough, and it may turn out that's someone's very first experience with this blog, which may be bad, but the consistency of there always being new content may be a benefit.

I may make a twitter poll and reach out to the technical writing discord I'm in and get opinions

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When it comes to a daily learning blog, would you be more interested to see consistently daily posts of occasionally incomplete/rough drafts, or fully fleshed-out posts with some occasional lag in posting? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysOfCode</a></p>&mdash; Max Lepper (@MaxLepper) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxLepper/status/1330893085941899265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

After posting, I immediately realized that my poll options were not entirely clear - "less frequent posting," which I intended to mean a reduction in post quantity overall, could be confused for "coherent drafts more often," which is what I'm doing right now, where post appear mostly human-readable but maybe I catch up one or two posts late (or 5, as is the case when I'm writing this). Regardless, I will 

ultimately, I want to make sure that supporting objectives of my learning process - blogging, networking, researching - do not negatively impact the core objective of "learning development." There has been a gap that has formed between periods of actually developing that, while helping to build a good mentality and set of soft skills, are not actually pushing my technical ability forward.
