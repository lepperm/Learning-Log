## Journal

({{page.references[0]}})

migrating backlog of reading information to Feedly
suspecting that I'll never _actually_ go back and read content, as I'm constantly being exposed to new information
Need a better way to organize and process incoming information, maybe learn to read faster?

really feeling overwhelmed

project idea pipeline
expose on learning log
perhaps utilize airtable, embed in a Projects page?
Could take advantage of linked lists and [rank-order prioritization](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_rank_ordered_backlog/), alternate views to create a more robust status list
Currently using Trello for project backlog, but starting to move everything towards Airtable because of the interaction between elements that it exposes
added projects page officially and worked to start filling in all of my active / professional project data

chatted with neal for a bit

trying to get more involved on twitter
still getting engagement from my 100daysofcode
following lots of people and trying to engage with their content
really amazing and inspiring people
not gonna lie, being back on social media makes me feel old. I know that it's not a big deal and I don't think I'm engaging like I'm old (but please someone let me know if that's not an accurate perception ðŸ˜¬ðŸ’¦)


stayed up late but was able to input all current projects, close out tabs, and clean up blog posts
really need to get back to shipping daily and selling on that consistency
probably not letting myself recover and drawing out the burnout
will probably take a slight break over the holidays

## Tasklist

- [x] Create a "Projects" Airtable and populate with projects
- [x] Create a "Projects" page
- [x] Clear out all current tabs and extra lingering notes
- [ ] [Change the `create-react-component-folder` template](https://github.com/snaerth/create-react-component-folder#publishing-templates) for [Storybook stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf) in my Portfolio
- [ ] Look into duplicated "Firebase" entries in Skills page on Learning Log
