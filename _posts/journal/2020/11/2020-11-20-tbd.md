## Journal

({{page.references[0]}})

discussion about motivation in irregular cafe
exploration of my passion for process, crafting process around a trajectory of an end target, and being willing to tear down and redesign the process if it is not properly getting towards the target

speaking of process
professional contact CRM system in airtable
had the idea a few days ago to add a conversation log
any major or time-boxed conversations or experiences would be good to capture
nice place to combine both my notes and my conversations, help automate tracking when I've reached out to people

## Tasklist

- [ ] [Change the `create-react-component-folder` template](https://github.com/snaerth/create-react-component-folder#publishing-templates) for Storybook stories in my Portfolio
- [ ] Look into duplicated "Firebase" entries in Skills page on Learning Log
