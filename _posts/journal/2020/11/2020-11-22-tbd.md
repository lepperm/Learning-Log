## Journal

({{page.references[0]}})

This weekend was good, but definitely emotionally difficult. My partner and I are close with our families and normally spend a ton of time together, and actively making the decision to stay away because we love them and want to have more time in the future is persistently challenging. It's nice making quick drive-by stops and video calls, but it definitely is not the same as just hanging out like we used to. To distract ourselves, we switched up decorations and redesigned the layout of our main apartment room.

These initiatives don't include:
- working a full-time job as an electrical controls specialist developing applications for fleets of mobile industrial equipment
- taking care of my health (sleep, exercise, diet)
- Time spent keeping my home and finances in order
- Spending time and developing my relationship with my spouse
- Socializing with friends and family and maintaining non-professional relationships
- Personal hobbies
- Relaxation

These are all excellent things and I can see the benefits of pushing all of them forward, however it's not sustainable to be trying to work on all of them all the time
I need to come up with some kind of schedule or pattern to keep all of these plates spinning together
