## Journal

A Reddit post about [avoidance]({{page.references[2]}})

**MORNING**
- [x] Get up at the same time as a typical workday.
- [x] Attend [Irregular Cafe]({{page.references[1]}}).
   - [x] If there is opportunity to discuss, follow up on book club books and express interest in participating. Both books sound excellent!
   - _The Practice_, book form of all the lessons from Product Lab
   - _Tiny MBA_, originally 100 tweets from tweetstorm into a book, each idea is a separate idea, very business-focused
   - I put my vote in for _The Practice_!
- [ ] Complete the [Yearly Prioritization Workbook from Susan Shu Chang]({{page.references[0]}}).
   - [ ] Summarize my findings and feelings from workbook.
   - [ ] Attempt to complete by lunch / early afternoon.

**AFTERNOON**
- [ ] Revisit the priority list from [11/22]({% link _posts/journal/2020/11/2020-11-22-the-spinning-plate-conundrum.md %}) and refine.
   - [ ] Try to identify overlap with the workbook.
   - [ ] Identify and weigh key objectives.
      - Consider formalized rank-order prioritization for in the future, too much overhead for today.
   - [ ] Additionally prioritize key objectives with respect to mentor tasks.
- [ ] Create either one or A/B weekly schedules for themed work sessions, with formal time slots.
   - [ ] The goal will be to try and take on objectives that fit with that day's theme, when it makes sense. Obviously, working on a project or intensive learning subject may take priority, but I want to keep all the plates spinning as much as possible.
   - [ ] Try to factor in "downtime," similar to an exercise routine, where maybe I follow up a few days of study with networking or generalized research.
   - [ ] I would like to formalize a time slot for book reading (15 minutes every day?). I currently squeeze reading into short walks, and it is not enough.

**EVENING**
- [ ] Develop a current "all fronts" action-item list of absolutely everything that I actively want to work on.
   - [ ] Sort this list into categories.
   - [ ] If applicable, assign time estimates to tasks.
   - [ ] Break down tasks bigger than one day into smaller related tasks.
   - [ ] Aim to _reduce_ my default daily commitments. I can always selectively opt into additional tasks.
   - [ ] Consider building this task list in Airtable and extracting tasks from the daily blogs. Include only completed tasks to reduce blog clutter.
- [ ] Collect and review all artifacts from the day.
- [ ] Post a draft blog (NOT live, leave it rough), recording my time and any major bullet points that I would like to include.
- [ ] Tweet out success of objectives, and any valuable immediate impressions.
- [ ] Stop and REST for the remainder of the evening.

## Tasklist

- [ ] Revisit the priority list from [11/22]({% link _posts/journal/2020/11/2020-11-22-the-spinning-plate-conundrum.md %}) and develop a schedule
- [ ] [Change the `create-react-component-folder` template](https://github.com/snaerth/create-react-component-folder#publishing-templates) for [Storybook stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf) in my Portfolio
