## Journal

Referring to the [AGWSU documentation]({{page.references[0]}}), I wanted to go through my React configuration script and add some documentation. This time, I actually tried generating the final documentation and seeing how it ends up being structured, which was very cool. I tried branching out and using a few different types of tags, like `@namespace`, but I'm not sure if I was getting them to work as intended, and ultimately ended up mostly including descriptions and parameters. The generated templates and files needed a little touch-up, too.

I could add in logic to build out a series of components, but I think I've spent enough time on this tangent already, and need to get back on track! Here's [my finished snippet on GitLab]({{page.references[1]}}).

Next up was to figure out what in the world was going on with my Prettier configuration. A while back, it suddenly stopped working on me. I assumed it was because I was breaking settings trying to write Liquid for Learning Log, but reviewing various setup guides, it looked like my settings were exactly what they should be. After searching around, I found issue #1598 on the prettier-vscode plugin GitHub repository, which says that there was ["no formatting after VSCode updated to 1.5.0"]({{page.references[2]}}).

Sure enough, it looks like I needed to add `"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"` to the `settings.json` for VS Code. I restarted for good measure, but now Prettier magically cleans up all my `'`s again! Looks like tonight ended up being a satisfying two-for-one win! ðŸ˜Š
