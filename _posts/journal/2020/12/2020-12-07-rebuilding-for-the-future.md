## Journal

{% include focus-box.html focus="Learning, Producing" theme="Portfolio" %}

There has been a lot of progress this past week, but as I seek to build my network and apply for roles, good branding and representation will be important. My portfolio is overdue for a redesign, and I'm strongly considering starting over from scratch. I know there were some issues with Storybook when I tried to integrate it on a fresh `create-react-app` build, but perhaps this has been resolved since then.

**Packages to utilize**
- firebase
- react-router-dom
- Material UI
- Prettier
- Storybook
- react-helmet
- [@loadable/component](https://loadable-components.com/docs/getting-started/)
  - <https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html>
  - <https://create-react-app.dev/docs/code-splitting/>
- Framer Motion (eventually? Low value at this stage)



- want to have a single core page (reference examples from a few posts back)
- react-router to swap out core contents
- mobile friendly
- persistent but minimal navbar and footer
- focus on keeping things clean with some stylization
- take time with components, want to build for flexibility over the long haul
- would like to use testing
- restructure repo, use tags and proper dedicated staging and production sites, maybe make staging password protected to help SEO on main?

How could I have my site function both with react and without? Do I need to re-build the site and do a `noscript` alternative CSS file, perhaps?
