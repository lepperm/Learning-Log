## Journal

{% include focus-box.html focus="Learning, Producing" theme="Portfolio" %}

continuing along with Framer tutorials, seems like it gets very deep! I suspect that I would be able to create a fully-functional prototype, with enough time.

That being said, as I get into more of the code previews, it seems like more trouble than it's worth for a 1-to-1 fidelity draft when I am also the developer. It definitely makes a lot of sense from the perspective of a designer getting approval from a client and communicating expected functionality to the development team, however!

Liking the look of [Phosphor icons](https://github.com/phosphor-icons/phosphor-home#phosphor-icons), may use as an alternative to Material UI icons

this thread was recommended to me about the design approach
https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/k9yyzq/how_do_you_guys_go_about_designing_webpages_i_see/

Started playing around with layout and spacing.
I have no idea what the heck I'm doing here!
different shades of blue boxes represent the structure of the site elements, to help me block things out

{% include blog-img.html source="/assets/images/posts/2020/12/09/framer_draft.png" alt="Extremely rough pass at laying my elements out in Framer...yikes!" %}

Really not sure what info to include on the side panel.

Is this a good idea? ðŸ˜•
