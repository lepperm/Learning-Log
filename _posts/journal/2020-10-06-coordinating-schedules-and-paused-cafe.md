## Journal

It sounds like [Irregular Café]({{page.references[0]}}) will be put on hold for a few weeks after this Friday, unfortunately. I understand that it didn't attract as much of a diverse crowd as intended, and participation has definitely dropped off in the past two weeks. With me going into the office, I didn't have anything particularly productive that I could work on in the morning besides reading, and I'm already reading until the words turn to mush each day, so it was a a chaotic force that got me excited and curious to get to work early to see who would show up and what we would talk about. I do worry about wearing out my welcome, showing up nearly every day, but I'm genuinely having a great time making the new connections and it's hard to resist.

Over on [Scrimmage Product Lab]({{page.references[1]}}), posting activity has picked up! I posted our daily updates to a new thread and read through everyone's content.

Neal and I had a chance to chat and are planning a design co-working session on TDC for tomorrow evening and some immediate action items. We also discussed content for our Product Lab post tomorrow. Apart from that, I've picked up _Your First Year In Code_ again to continue where I left off.
