## Journal

Just another small log to clock some time, but I was having a difficult time relaxing and decided to give [FreeCodeCamp]({{page.references[0]}}) a bit more time. While it is very easy so far, I've read that the projects are excellent, and that the JavaScript certification is a solid challenge. Even in the very first HTML section, I learned a tiny detail I had not yet encountered about interacting with checkboxes and radio buttons in forms, so this will be an good way to fill in the gaps in my current understanding and help my foundation.

While I was at it, I added details about my progression to a collapsible section in Tasks and made some minor tweaks to improve the quality of my CSS.
