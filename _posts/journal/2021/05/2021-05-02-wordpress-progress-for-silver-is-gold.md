After sleeping on it the night after posting my last post, I decided to try something drastic. Using a plugin called WP Reset, I completely reset the site to a (mostly) blank canvas. Now that I have a slightly better idea of what's going on, I'll take things one step at a time and focus on functionality.

First up was restoring the "coming soon" page. I had exported my settings prior to resetting, but wanted to see if I could find a plugin that would give me a bit more control over the landing page design. Two plugins with pretty aggressively restricted premium features later, I returned to my original plugin and re-imported my settings. Worth a shot!

Next up was determining which site builder engine to go with. I had played around with Elementor a little before resetting, and while it seemed powerful, much of it was again locked behind a paywall. Gutenberg, on the other hand, looks to be the "native" option. While reading up on comparisons, multiple articles claimed it was quicker, lighter, and full-featured, and that there were more free options for extending the functionality.

Honestly, if I had one core takeaway from using Wordpress so far, it's "bring a budget." It seems that you can't type anything in the plugin search bar without tripping over $40 yearly subscription plugins!

This time around, I grabbed the Neve theme, as it looks like it has a decent selection of themes that are available for multiple site builder plugins. Ideally, this would mean that maybe it'd be easier to switch things up in the future, if needed. WP Job Manager will be the underlying engine for the job board again, as the free offering seems to be enough to get something functional up, and expandability and support seems to be solid.

Although, immediately after writing this, I decided to perform more exhaustive research:

### Job Board Plugins

https://wpjobboard.net/
- Seems to be a little bit of everything in a single package
- Nice looking backend admin panel
- Independent employer and candidate sign-ups!
- Great job posting flow
- Was unable to go through the entire flow for a paid posting, unsure if true error or disabled on demo site
- Easy contact forms in both directions, doesn't hide info away
- Employer panel, easy to review applications with printable summary pages
- Candidate panel, profile completion, alerts, memberships, bookmarks - this looks awesome
- Company directory with all posted opportunities
- Multiple options for closing out opportunities
- Looks great on default themes??

https://wordpress.org/plugins/js-jobs/
- I personally like the report dashboards and graphs, because that's just the kind of person I am
- Sounds like there are some mixed reviews, warnings of serious bugs that require deep understanding of WP to resolve. May be too much to try and tackle at this point

https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-job-board/
- Looks okay, although the demo site looks like maybe it was repurposed from a dating site theme?? Pretty sure marital status isn't a trait typically associated with a company.
- Has many positive reviews
- Struggling to see much benefit over WP Job Board or WP Job Manager

Honestly, I like WP Job Board a whole heck of a lot. It seems incredibly full-featured for a better overall price than WP Job Manager. The biggest challenge with **any** plugin is probably going to be the word "job," which was one of the bigger pieces of feedback from my sync meeting with the client on 4/26. WP Job Board does specifically mention that it provides access to the source code and documentation, so maybe it would also be a bit easier to modify, and it looks like we'd get assistance with the paid license which could help point me in the right direction and not break things (too much).

### Accessibility Plugins

I know that there is little substitution for manually-configured and focused accessibility efforts. That being said, I haven't yet dug into accessibility and ADA compliance with the attention and understanding that it requires. To supplement and to help learn what things to look out for, I'd like to add some accessibility plugins.

https://wordpress.org/plugins/pojo-accessibility/
- Toolbar to modify user experience on the site
- One user comments that using the toolbar itself poses an accessibility issue, as it doesn't inform users about the expanded state

https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/
- Sounds like a good tool to help fix some basic accessibility issues

https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility-helper/
- Looks pretty nice and appears to work well on demo site
- Unsure exactly what's free and what's paid

https://wordpress.org/plugins/accessible-poetry/
- Reviews suggest this is one of the better toolbar options
- Has not been updated in a while, out of support
- No demo

https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ada-compliance-check-basic/
- Free version does a content check for general compliance issues, does not check theme
- May be a good learning tool for me

The house repairs front has been _relentless_! Everyone I've spoken with has told me to "get used to it" so it sounds like this is a common experience for new homeowners, haha. My big push this past week has been focused on our main bathroom.

The shower wasn't working and the fan blower was burnt out and disconnected, so it's unravelled into this sprawling multi-step process of adding roof vents, adding ducting, creating access points in the attic, getting a custom-made blower motor since we'd have to modify the roof structure to accommodate a modern ceiling unit, fixing the electrical, and on and on and on. I'm learning a ton and getting more comfortable with digging into the house, but it'd be nice to actually check something off the list instead of adding two or three more steps every time I mark one step off! Thankfully, we were able to get the balancing check valve loose and replaced in the shower _without_ having to drill and extract it, which is what I was anticipating needing to do with how things have gone so far!

I know we'll get there, and in terms of percent complete-ness, the house it honestly most of the way there! The remaining tasks are all high-complexity items with a good deal of unknowns we are slowly solving, or items that will just take time (like acquiring, painting, and installing trim).
