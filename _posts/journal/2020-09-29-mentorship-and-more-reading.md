## Journal

A topic that came up this morning during [Irregular Caf√©]({{page.references[0]}}) was mentorship. This is something that I've absolutely been interested in, but have been unsure how to tactfully approach. Should I be at a certain skill level first? What is okay to ask? I have this internal sense of needing to somehow prove myself first before it is acceptable to seek out more direct guidance, but right now I can't gauge how much of that is realistic versus perception. I need to read up and understand better if there is any established etiquette. Exhausting or over-tapping good connections is also a concern, which is part of the motivation for building up a professional CRM.

Later tonight, I should be meeting with Neal about Scrimmage Product Lab. Our registration emails have been delivered, and we start Thursday. My goal is to finish reading [JFS]({{page.references[1]}}), and I'm slowly getting there whenever I find a few minutes to read.

On the blog, I finally expanded `min-to-time` to cover years. Without getting even more overly precise, months and years are calculated assuming 365-day years and 30.417 day months, and a tilde is added to indicate the approximation. Right now, it's mostly just courses that will have numbers that large.

## Tasklist
