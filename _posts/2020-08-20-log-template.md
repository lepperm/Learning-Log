improvements to tasks
better suggested tasks when no tasks in progress

In an effort to have the Task page opening text be more helpful, I spent hours trying to figure out sequencing to collect and iterate through the data, but to have the initial div update correctly. This feels like a place where React would really shine. I tried manually building the div and using append child, I tried combining the loops with forloop triggers, I tried doing imports....but eventually settled on re-calling the collection loop. I feel bad about it, but there's a certain amount of time where it makes more sense to move on, learn more, and come back to it later.
