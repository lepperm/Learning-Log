## Journal

It would be really nice to automate setting up and time-stamping these new entries! I have heard about Gulp, and it is on my list of things to look into more, because I could do with more automation in my life.

[]({{page.references[0]}})

## Tasks

- [ ] Try to capture an `include` call to a Liquid array processing function to simplify array handling
- [ ] Figure out how to sort Skills alphabetically
- [ ] Figure out how to create the top references output
